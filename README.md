These are my solutions to exercises from [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) in Scheme. I have taken
up a personal quest to read the SICP through and through. I am hoping
to walk up the tree of abstraction as a result! 

I am blogging about it on
[my personal blog](http://mohitthatte.com/blog/categories/sicp).

Any feedback/advice is most welcome! 

Along the way I intend to try some of the problems in
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) in order to gain some practice in a
new language.
